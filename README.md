# nodejs-rest-starter
A simple modular real-time nodejs rest api starter. The idea is to have a Real-time REST API without having to add firebase library in the client-side to listen for updates

# TODO
  - [x]  Add index.html for demo;
  - [x]  Add controllers;
  - [x]  Add services;
  - [x]  Add models;
  - [x]  Emit events from the server so the API's has its own events and don't need to use firebase in the client; those events watch for database changes
  - [ ]  More services, controllers and models;
  - [ ]  Complete CRUD
  - [ ]  Authentication;
  - [ ]  Machine learning integration;
